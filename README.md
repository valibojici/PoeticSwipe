## Things I learned
#### Mocking with Mockito
I learned and utilized mocking techniques in Flutter using [Mockito](https://pub.dev/packages/mockito).

#### Depedency Injection
To achieve better code organization and decoupling of dependencies, I implemented dependency injection using the [GetIt](https://pub.dev/packages/get_it).

#### State management
For managing the app's state accross different widgets I used the popular provider package for Flutter [Provider](https://pub.dev/packages/provider).
